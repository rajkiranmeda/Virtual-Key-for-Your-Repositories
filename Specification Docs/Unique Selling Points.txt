Unique Selling Points of the Application
1. The application is designed to keep on running and taking user inputs even after exceptions occur. 
   To terminate the application, appropriate option needs to be selected.
2. The application can take any file/folder name as input. Even if the user wants to create nested folder structure, 
   user can specify the relative path, and the application takes care of creating the required folder structure.
