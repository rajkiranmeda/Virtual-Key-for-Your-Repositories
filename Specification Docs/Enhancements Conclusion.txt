Conclusions
Further enhancements to the application can be made which may include:
• Conditions to check if user is allowed to delete the file or add the file at the specific locations.
• Asking user to verify if they really want to delete the selected directory if it’s not empty.
• Retrieving files/folders by different criteria like Last Modified, Type, etc.
• Allowing user to append data to the file.
